React.JS
	a JS Library used for UI
	Started by Facebook
	Maintained by Facebook and Instagram
	Is a View - the V in MVC
	For developing single page applications

Virtual Dom
	Is a JS Object
	Faster than Real DOM
	Only writes to real dom when necessary
	Only renders data that has been changed 
		This is unlike DOM which must render all data
		This is why the DOM is so slow
	Get state info from the virtual DOM with getDOMNode()

Using React
	Click on download link on the React website
	Find the "Production" script tag (currently v.0.13.3)
	Insert into document head
	React.Render() starts any piece of react code

	React.Render(React.CreateElement('div', null, 'hello world'), document.body);
		This code will create a div element with no properties that says
		hellow world inside of the document body.

	React.createElement(what, properties, content);

JSX
	JSX - Javascript XML
	Makes code similar to XML
	Must first be converted to Javascript before it will run in the browser.

Babel
	JS Compiler
	http://www.babeljs.io
	Use v.5.8 for now - it's Quicker!
	Link in Script tag in header
	Give React Code Script a type of text/babel 
		- <script type="text/babel">
	

Using JSX
	var HelloWord = React.createClass({
		Render: function(){
			return{
				<div>
					<h1>hello world</h1>
				</div>
				);
				}
			});

	React.render(<helloworld/>, document.body);

	Notice that var name is called in XML style
	HTML is returned and rendered to the body


How to tell if a page is using React
	React compnents are compostable.
		UI comprised of different components.
	Any website built with react has the react logo on the right side of teh address bar.
	You can open a react developer panel
		Opens in the same way you would inspect an element
		This will tell you where on the page react is being used.

Creating a React Component
	React.Render can only return one compnent at a time unless wrapped inside of a container
	ex:
		React.Render(<div>
					<helloworld/>
					<helloworld/>
					<helloworld/>
				</div>, document.body);

Properties
	Sending properties to a compnent in a similar to adding some attributes to HTML
	this.props.(var name)
		how you would call your function ft. the defined var.

		ex:
		<helloworld text="stuffandthings"/>
		<h1>{this.props.text}</h1>

		This would create an h1 saying stuff and things".


Other Notes:
	When declaring functions within a class you do not need to declare a var
		Syntax similar to backbone
	Instead of declaring a class, declare a className
	JQuery can be used inside of obejcts.
	ex:
		<button onClick={this.Remove} className="btn">

Checkboxes
	var checkbox = React.createClass({
					getInitialState: function({
								  return {checked:false}
								  }. //checkbox is unchecked at start
								  handleCheck:function(){
											this.setState({checked:!this.state.checked})
											},
										Render: function(){
												  var msg;
											if(this.state.checked){
													      msg = "checked";
													      }
													       else
													      {
     														 msg = "unchecked";
      													      }
														return(<div><input type="checkbox" onChange={this.handleCheck}/><p>{msg}</p></div>);
													      
												   }
												});
